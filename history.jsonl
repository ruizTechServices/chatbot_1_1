{"userMessage":"What is the meaning of life?","botResponse":"The meaning of life is a question that has been contemplated by philosophers, theologians, and thinkers for centuries, and it can vary greatly depending on cultural, religious, and personal perspectives. Some people find meaning through religious or spiritual beliefs, others through connections with family and friends, the pursuit of knowledge, or contributing to society. Existential and philosophical viewpoints, such as those from existentialism, suggest that life has no inherent meaning, and it is up to each individual to create their own purpose. Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal and subjective question, and the answer can be different for each person."}
